# recipes

The purpose of this project is to display the elementary skills I've learned,
so far, about HTML 5.

The task is to create a Recipe page that contains a picture, description, set of ingredients, and instructions. Although, thtose are the minimum requirements set by The Odin Project, I wanted to stretch myself. So, using HTML, I modified the background and font colors. I used HTML, since I don't, yet, know CSS. But, plan to revisit this project once I do.

Additionally, I modified the font-size and font-family using HTML to replicate (well, try) Liv B's layout. And I also created relative links to the "home" and related recipe pages, in an effort to create better navigation.
