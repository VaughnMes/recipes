        <h5>DESCRIPTION</h5>
        <p>Entirely plant-based buttermilk biscuits. Theyâ€™re flaky, dotted with pockets of cheddar, and absolutely addictive with a
        pat of butter and some jam!</p>
        
        <h5>INGREDIENTS</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup unsweetened original nondairy milk</li>
            <li>1 tsp white vinegar</li>
            <li>2â€“1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
            <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cold vegan butter (1 stick)</li>
            <li>1 cup vegan cheddar shreds</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5>INSTRUCTIONS</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 F.</li>
            <li>Mix together the nondairy milk and vinegar and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl or a food processor, add the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt and mix until combined.</li>
            <li>If using a food processor: Add butter and pulse until incorporated into a crumbly, dry mixture.
                If using a knife or grater: Cut butter into very small pieces. Mix with the flour by hand or with a pastry blender until
                incorporated into a crumbly, dry mixture.</li>
            <li>Stir in the cheddar shreds until combined.</li>
            <li>Add the buttermilk, reserving about 1 tbsp of it to brush the tops. Stir with a wooden spoon until just combined.</li>
            <li>Lightly dust a clean surface with flour and turn the dough out onto the surface, using your hands to form a rectangle.
                Cut the rectangle into 4 sections, then stack them on top of each other and press down to squish them together (this is
                how you get nice flaky layers!)</li>
            <li>Use hands to form a rectangle about 1-inch thick, then cup out biscuit shapes with a cookie cutter or glass.</li>
            <li>Place on a baking sheet and brush the tops with the reserved buttermilk. Bake 12 minutes, until golden brown on top.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and let cool slightly before serving. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2
                days, or in the fridge up to 4 days.</li>
        </ol>
