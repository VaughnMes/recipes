        <h5>DESCRIPTION</h5>
        <p>These pancakes use minimal ingredients that you can find at any store, and with a little practice it is easy to get the
        hang of nailing the perfect pancakes every time.</p>

        <h5>INGREDIENTS</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup Almond Breeze Original Almondmilk</li>
            <li>1 tsp apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>INSTRUCTIONS</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the Almond Breeze Original Almondmilk and apple cider vinegar, stirring well. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the oil to the almondmilk mixture and stir. Then pour into dry mixture.</li>
            <li>Mix until JUST combined. Lumps are okay! Do not over-mix. See video for what the batter should look like.</li>
            <li>Heat a frying pan to medium heat. Spray oil lightly onto pan.</li>
            <li>Using scoop batter into round pancake shapes, leaving some room for spreading. I usually do 2 at a time. BE PATIENT! Let
            it cook until bubbles rise to the surface then burst, and the edges start to look cooked. Take a peak underneath and if
            it is golden, flip to the other side. Cook about 30 seconds-1 minute on the other side (the second side takes much less
            time to cook).</li>
        </ol>
